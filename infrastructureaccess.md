# Infrastructure permissions
{: #infrapermission}

You can set the following initial permission sets when you invite a user:

| Permission set | Description of actions |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
|View Only | Users with this permission can view only items within the system. For example, users can view tickets, hardware and virtual server details, licenses, bandwidth details, and the account summary, which includes invoices and payments. |
|Basic User | Users with this permission can view, search, add, and edit tickets, manage devices that they are granted access to, add IP addresses, manage email delivery services, add, edit, and view DNS records, add new users with access to infrastructure, and manage notifications. |
|Super User | Users with this permission can complete all actions available in the system. |

Extra permissions can be set after the user accepts the invitation. The initial permission set assigned on the invitation does not grant access to devices. So, you must grant device access in the control portal after the user accepts the invitation. 

When you invite someone to the account, only you and the master user of the SoftLayer account can adjust the permissions for the user. If you are assigning the permissions and you are not the master user, you can assign only the level of permissions or a subset of the permissions that you are already assigned. However, a master user can update anyone's permissions in the account to have any level of access. 

Go to the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg), and then select **Infrastructure** to access the control portal for working with user permissions for infrastructure. Going to **Account** &gt; **Users** displays your users list where you can set device access and other infrastructure permissions. For more information about assigning access, go to [Managing infrastructure access](/docs/iam/mnginfra.html#managing-infrastructure-access).
