# Infrastructure permissions
{: #infrapermission}

You can set the following initial permission sets when you invite a user:

| Permission set | Description of actions |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
|View Only | Users with this permission can only view items within the system.|
|Basic User | Users with this permission can perform basic actions within the system, such as adding a ticket and managing devices they have been granted access to. |
|Super User | Users with this permission can perform all actions available in the system. |

Additional permissions can be set after the user has accepted the invitation. The initial permission set assgined on the invitation does not grant access to devices, so you must grant device access in the control portal after the user has accepted the invitation. 

Go to the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg), and then select **Infrastructure** to access the control portal for working with user permissions for infrastructure. Going to **Account** &gt; **Users** displays your users list where you can set device access and other infrastructure permissions. For more information, go to [Managing infrastructure access](/docs/iam/mnginfra.html#managing-infrastructure-access).
