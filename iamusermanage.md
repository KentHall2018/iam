# Working with users
{: #iamusermanage}

Depending on the access options that you are authorized to manage, you can view and manage users across the account or organizations that you own or manage. From the Users list for your account, you can see both platform and infrastructure users.
{:shortdesc}

To manage users in your account, complete the following steps:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Account** &gt; **Users**. The Users window displays a list of users with their email addresses for the currently selected account.
2. Select the user name, or click **Manage user** from the **Actions** menu.
3. Then, depending on what action you need to take, you can choose to remove the user, assign access, or edit the user's existing access.

For details on the CLI commands that are used to manage accounts, orgs, and spaces, see [Commands for managing accounts, orgs, and roles](/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/bx_cli.html#bx_commands_acctorg).
