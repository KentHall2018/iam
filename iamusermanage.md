# Managing users and access
{: #iamusermanage}

Depending on the access options that you are authorized to manage, you can view and manage users across the account or organization. As an account owner, you can manage users in any of the access options that you administer and to which the user is assigned access in the current account.
{:shortdesc}

To manage users in your account, complete the following steps:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Account** &gt; **Users**. The Users window displays a list of users with their email addresses for the currently selected account. 
2. Select the user name, or click **Manage user** from the **Actions** menu. 
3. Then, depending on what access you can manage, update the access for the user in the Service policies or Cloud Foundry roles sections, or click the link to access the Assign Infrastructure Access page.

Review the following sections for additional information about managing each type of access.

If you need to review your assigned access in an account that you have been added to, complete the following steps:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Security** &gt; **Identity & Access** &gt; **Users**. 
2. Select your name. 
3. Review your assigned roles.

If you need additional privileges, you must contact the organization manager or account owner to update the Cloud Foundry role, or contact the administrator for the service or service instance to update the service policy.

For details on the CLI commands that are used to manage accounts, orgs, and spaces, see [Commands for managing accounts, orgs, and roles](/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/bx_cli.html#bx_commands_acctorg).
