# Working with users
{: #iamusermanage}

Depending on the access options that you are authorized to manage, you can view and manage users across the account or organizations that you own or manage. From the Users list for your account, you can see both platform and infrastructure users.

To manage users in your account, complete the following steps to access the options for removing users, assigning access, and editing assigned access:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Account** &gt; **Users**. The Users window displays a list of users with their email addresses for the currently selected account.
2. Select the user name, or click **Manage user** from the **Actions** menu.
3. Then, depending on what action you need to take, you can choose to remove the user, assign access, or edit the user's existing access.

**Note**: Only account owners can remove users from the account.

For details on the CLI commands that are used to manage accounts, orgs, and spaces, see [Commands for managing accounts, orgs, and roles](/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud/cli_acct_org_role.html#commands-for-managing-accounts-orgs-and-roles).
{: tip}

You can also create access groups to organize a set of users and service IDs to make assigning access to more than one user at a time a quick and easy process:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Security** &gt; **Identity and Access**, and then select **Access Groups**.
2. Click **Create access group**.
3. Enter a name and description for your group, and click **Create**.
4. After your group is created, click the name of the group to get started by adding users and assigning access to the group.
