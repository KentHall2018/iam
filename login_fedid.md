# Using an API key to log in with a federated ID
{: #federated_id}


A [federated ID](/docs/admin/adminpublic.html#federatedid) is an ID within a company's domain that has been registered with IBM so that the domain and user credentials can be used to access IBM web applications. As a federated user, you can log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} from the command-line interface (CLI) by using either a one-time passcode or an API key. By using an API key, you can automate the login process through the CLI.

For step-by-step instructions on creating an API key to automate the login process by using the CLI, see [Creating an API key](/docs/iam/userid_keys.html#creating-an-api-key). 

For instructions on using a one-time passcode or an API key that you've already created in the CLI, see [Logging in with a federated ID](/docs/cli/login_federated_id.html#federated_id).
