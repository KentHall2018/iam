Previously, assigning user access was limited to Cloud Foundry orgs and spaces. 

Now with the new IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management, fine-grained access control is available!

To get started, select the user and then choose a policy type.

A resource group policy can allow a user access to everything in a resource group based on their role. 

A single resource policy offers further fine-grained control by granting user access to a single resource or resource instance. 

To learn more about how access management works head over to the documentation for IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management.
