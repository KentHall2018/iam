# IAM events tracking
{: #tracking}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull}} service to track how users and applications interact with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). 

You can track the following events:

* Managing access groups by creating and deleting groups or adding and removing users
* Creating, updating, or deleting service IDs
* Creating, updating, or deleting API keys
* Creating, updating, or deleting access policies
* Logging in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} by using an API key, authorization code, passcode, password, or an API key associated with a service ID

To get started monitoring your user's actions, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull_notm}}](/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker/index.html#getting-started-with-cla). For more information about each of the event areas that you can track, see [IAM events](/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker/services/at_events_iam.html).
